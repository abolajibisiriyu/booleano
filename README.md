This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

At its core it uses :
- [React query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) for Data fetching.
- React context for state management.
- [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/) for writing styles.
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React testing library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro) for testing.
